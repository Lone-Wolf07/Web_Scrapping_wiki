# Web_Scrapping_wiki
A web scrapping project using BeautifulSoup in python

This is a fun little project that I am doing in my summer break. The beauty of this is that it can be used as a strting gateway to AI/ML or for web dev
My first plan was to use Selenium, recommended by my friend who got me interested in coding in the first place.
Later on I realised that even though it wroks and looks cool, I'll just do it with BeautifulSoup so that it appears more mysterious. 
Though i will prorbably upolad again with selenium cuz it's just way more cool

Takeaway from this project:
    Python is just cool, way too many cool libraries. Also understood how web pages are structured
